# Text-adventure
## Directions


### Installing Required Packages


in the VS Code Command Line type the following command:

`pip install pysqlite`

and 

`pip install sqlalchemy`

### Downloading the code

First click on the green button labeled `Code`

next click on `download ZIP`

unzip the file to the desired location


### Running the Game

open `text_based_adventure_game` in VS Code and run `Main.py`

I like to have a split screen above the command prompt with `encyclopedia.txt` on one side and `output.txt` on the other while I am playing.

Enjoy!
